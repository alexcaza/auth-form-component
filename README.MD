# Auth Form Component

This was made because I've been wanting to play around with React for a long time, but haven't thought of anything to do with it.

These components don't really have any function, I just wanted to play around with the framework and try out a form component I've wanted to build.

If you find use in it, fantastic! If not, that's fine! I'd love some feedback on the code and structure, as well. I've read a lot of theory, but haven't done much in practice.
